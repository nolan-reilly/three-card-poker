# Three Card Poker

This project is a complete Three Card Poker game, entirely made in Java. It includes classes such as Card, Deck, Player, Dealer, and ThreeCardLogic. More than 90 test cases were written to thoroughly verify the game logic. The UI was built with JavaFX, featuring a responsive layout along with animations and sound effects.
